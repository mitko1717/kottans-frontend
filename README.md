## 0. Git Basics

The course of udacity ***Version Control with Git*** firstly was difficult for me, cause it was my very first experiense with git. I've begun it 3 times over and over. but with help of mentors in telegram chat i've done all tasks and now i realized that **git** is very useful.
and ***learngitbranching.js.org*** helped me to understand git vizually.
